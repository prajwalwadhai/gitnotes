# Week 0: What helped me start contributing to Git, distilled into Aphorisms

This is my Git contribution log as a part of [my GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4754589292691456).

I have decided to write what I considered helpful for bagging the selection in the style of [aphorisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism), mostly to stop myself from rambling.

* Perservere, but only with purpose and planning. Time is your ally when you account for it.
* Learn the codebase by going top-down, then bottom-up. Top-down to locate, bottom-up to understand.
* The mailing list search bar is your friend.
* The commit message is your friend.
* If a piece of code confounds you, `git blame` that line and see the commit log to help you understand.
* If it still confounds you, move on. Sort out that black box later.
* Your first, and probably the second patch, is going to be bad. Don't let that stop you from contributing more.
* Do not respond to mail impulsively. Carefully read what you are told.
